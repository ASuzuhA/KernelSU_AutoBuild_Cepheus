# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: build_kernel

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
#   push:
#     branches: [ "main" ]
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job

      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
